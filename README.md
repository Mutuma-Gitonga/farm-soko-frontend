# FarmSoko
### The Fresh Organic Food Market!

## Overall Project Description
- FarmSoko is the convergence point of farmers and consumers. 
- On the one hand, FarmSoko enhances the reach and visibility of farmers' produce whatever it may be. It's particularly a favorable and convenient platform since it allows them to pitch various produce for sale whilst specifying the quantity, units, unit prices, rather than dictating strict produce characteristics.
- On the other hand, FarmSoko allows consumers to browse through available produce and purchase to their liking.
