# FarmSoko
### The Fresh Organic Food Market!

## Overall Project Description
- FarmSoko is the convergence point of farmers and consumers. 
- On the one hand, FarmSoko enhances the reach and visibility of farmers' produce whatever it may be. It's particularly a favorable and convenient platform since it allows them to pitch various produce for sale whilst specifying the quantity, units, unit prices, rather than dictating strict produce characteristics.
- On the other hand, FarmSoko allows consumers to browse through available produce before making a purchase decision. 

## User Stories
- Farmers anchor this website since it cannot exist without their produce. 
- A farmer signs up and is logged into the account.
- The onus is the farmer to use the form to make a product post using the provide form. 
- A farmer is able to view own produce in this logged in state. 
- However, once a farmer signs out, they have a similar functionality as consumers. 
- In other words, the home page in the logged out state lists all available produce. 
- This listing contains the relevant product information such as farmer name, town, and phone number to aid the decision process.

## Known Bugs
- I am not aware of any current bugs. However, I am open to any project improvement suggestions. 

## Contributing
- Currently a solo pursuit. I would love to include the consumer signup feature that would allow them to purchase produce and have a record of it. 
- In addition, I shall improve the website's user interface.
